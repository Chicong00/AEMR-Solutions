###  1. What are the most common outage types?
````sql

    Reason,
    Start_Year,
    count(1) total_number_outage_events
from dbo.aemo
where status = 'Approved' 
GROUP by Start_Year, Reason, [Status]
Order by Start_Year, total_number_outage_events DESC
````

## Part 2: Energy Losses and Market Reliability
### 1. Of the outage types in 2016 and 2017, what percent were forced outages?
````sql
with forced_outage as
( select 
    Start_Year,
    count(1) total_no_Forced_outage_events 
  from dbo.AEMO WHERE Reason = 'Forced' and [Status] = 'Approved'

### 2. What was the average duration for each outage during both 2016 and 2017? Have we seen an increase in the average duration of each outage?
````sql
